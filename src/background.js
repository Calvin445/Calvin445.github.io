                As a student, I love learning because it allows me to interact with the world in a meaningful way, 
                whether that's through building <a class="fancy-link" href="#projects">cool stuff</a> or analyzing 
                the ethical concerns of new technologies.
                </br></br>
                I'm also a passionate problem solver that thrives in challenging work environments. 
                I chose computer science, so I could tackle tough problems and make an impact on the world.

                If I'm not coding, I'm probably rocking out on the saxophone, working out at the gym, rock climbing, 
                or listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1220252461?si=huYA2NJFTpiB_CuiVUSyTw" class="fancy-link">music</a>.
